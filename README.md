# Daily Report Email | Python

#### This Python script automates the daily sending of email reports using the ```smtplib``` library for email functionality and ```schedule``` library for task scheduling. The script is designed to send a daily report email at 12:00 PM to a specified recipient.

### Step 1: Set Up the Project

1.Before running this script, make sure you have the smtplib and schedule libraries installed:

```bash
pip install secure-smtplib
pip install schedule
```


Also, to use Gmail, you might need to enable access to less secure apps in your Google account settings.

__Remember to replace "your_email@gmail.com", "your_password", and "recipient@gmail.com" with your actual email addresses.__

Note: Using a password directly in the code is not secure. In a real project, it's recommended to use environment variables or other secure methods to store passwords.
